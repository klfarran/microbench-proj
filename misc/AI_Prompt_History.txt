		AI prompt: "how do i add a gitattributes, can can i do it in my own branch and then merge into root later?"
		AI response: 	1. Create the .gitattributes file

						Inside your repo (on your branch):

						touch .gitattributes


						Then edit it, e.g., with nano or any text editor, and add:

						# Force all text files to use LF line endings
						* text=auto

						# Optional: force certain file types
						*.c text
						*.h text
						*.sh text eol=lf
						*.md text


						This tells Git how to treat files for line endings.
						
						2. Add and commit it on your branch
						
						git add .gitattributes
						git commit -m "Add .gitattributes to normalize line endings"

			AI prompt: how do i add an untracked file to the staging area making sure it is renormalized?
			AI response: Good question 👍

				If you want to add a new untracked file and make sure it follows your .gitattributes rules (for example, normalizing line endings), you can do:

				git add --renormalize <file>


				That forces Git to check the file against .gitattributes filters (like * text=auto eol=lf) and normalize it before staging.

				Alternatively, if you want to be extra sure:

				Make sure .gitattributes has the rule (e.g., * text=auto eol=lf).

				Run:

				git add --renormalize .


				This tells Git to re-scan and re-apply normalization to all files being staged (including untracked ones).

				👉 For a single new file, git add --renormalize filename is enough.

				Would you like me to also show you how to check that Git actually staged the file with LF endings instead of CRLF?
